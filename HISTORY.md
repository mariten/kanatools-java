v1.2.1 :: Feb 25 2016
======================
* Can now build using either Gradle or Ant
* Like existing Ant build process, new Gradle build process handles compilation, unit testing, coverage report, and JAR creation
    * Big thanks to [@knshiro](https://github.com/knshiro) for the pull request!
    * He wrote the initial `build.gradle` and tweaked it to run with this repo
* Updated Travis CI build config to ensure success of both Gradle-style and Ant-style builds
* Also fixed some minor Javadoc inconsistencies caught and alerted by Gradle `javadoc` analyzer


v1.2.0 :: Sep 11 2015
======================
* Added **KanaAppraiser**, provides numerous functions to check whether a character is hiragana, katakana, hankaku, zenkaku, ASCII, and more
* Include 100% unit test coverage for new class
* Refactor code in **KanaConverter** to utilize **KanaAppraiser** since this logic has been part of the conversion logic up until now


v1.1.2 :: Aug 14 2015
======================
* Library now supports older versions of Java back to 1.5 courtesy of better compiler options specified in build.xml
* Fixed exclusion of the tilde character during zenkaku <--> hankaku ascii conversion
    * Big thanks to [@NotSoOldNick](https://github.com/NotSoOldNick)!
* Added basic integration testing script that tests a stand-alone Java program which includes the **kanatools** JAR file and calls `kanaConvert` on sample input


v1.1.1 :: Aug 07 2015
======================
* Added JaCoCo code coverage report to `ant test` build process - provides line-by-line guide to which code within the source file is actually executed during unit testing
* Using the info learned from JaCoCo, added coverage for a few remaining edge cases and refactored the code slightly to achieve 100% coverage for **KanaConverter**
* Also changed scope of `createOpsArrayFromString` to private


v1.1.0 :: Jan 02 2015
======================
* Added ability to exclude certain characters from conversion in the `kanaConvert` function.
* Updated EN and JA documentation accordingly.
* Setup for Travis CI auto unit testing and added the "build status" image to README


v1.0.0 :: Dec 19 2014
======================
* Initial fully-operational version of **KanaConverter**
* Include space character conversion in zenkaku/hankaku ascii conversions (breaking with `mb_convert_kana`, but more convenient)
* Collapse hankaku diacritic marks by default (breaking with `mb_convert_kana`, but more convenient).  Removed operation to collapse marks (`OP_COLLAPSE_HANKAKU_VOICE_MARKS`), and then added new operation to request not collapsing diacritic marks (`OP_KEEP_DIACRITIC_MARKS_SEPARATE`).
* Shortened names of operation constants, makes for easier calling
* Do not exclude conversion of `'`, `"`, and `\` when performing zenkaku or hankaku ASCII conversions (breaking with and PHP's `mb_convert_kana`).  This is an unnecessary safety check (MySQL and/or programmatic escaping should be left to user), and prevented users from being able to convert those three characters using this library.
* Added EN/JA documentation website using GitHub Pages
* Wrote basic download/install/usage documentation in README


v0.9.0 :: Nov 17 2014
======================
* Improved build process, make direct command-line based PHP testing optional (off by default for `ant test`)
* Fixed bugs found in some multi-method conversions, and optimized main loop of the `convertKana` function
* Added multi-method unit tests (include those unusual cases where conflicting methods are unnaturally mixed together) and error cases.  Also split up unit tests into multiple files.
* Cleaned up code, added Javadocs where helpful
* Wrote basic download/install/usage documentation in README


v0.5.0 :: Oct 31 2014
======================
* Beta version of **KanaConverter**
* Implemented remaining methods, including those related to Hankaku Katakana handling
* Re-organized code for more modularity, more effectively spliting up different logic into different functions
* Unit tests for each single method that cover each conversion types full character span, as well as a mixed input test string


v0.1.0 :: Jun 11 2014
======================
* Alpha implementation of **KanaConverter**
* Partial functionality, handles most conversion methods except those related to Hankaku Katakana
* Unit tests for each method via JUnit
