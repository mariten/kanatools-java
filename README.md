### Example
```java
String before = "ﾃｽﾃｨﾝｸﾞ　１−２−３";

int conv_op_flags = 0;
conv_op_flags |= KanaConverter.OP_HAN_KATA_TO_ZEN_KATA;    //半角カタカナを全角カタカナに変換
conv_op_flags |= KanaConverter.OP_ZEN_ASCII_TO_HAN_ASCII;  //全角英数字を半角英数字に変換

String after = KanaConverter.convertKana(before, conv_op_flags);
```

Effect:
```
before: "ﾃｽﾃｨﾝｸﾞ　１−２−３"
after:  "テスティング 1-2-3"
```
